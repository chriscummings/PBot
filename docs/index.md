    --8<-- "version"


# PBot

PBot is a lightweight, Dockerized framework for building Discord chatbots that
can run on as little as a Raspberry Pi. It strips away the boilerplate so you
can focus on the fun parts of creating your bot.

## Who is this Project Meant for?

PBot is designed for anyone who wants to spin up a private Discord bot with
minimal setup. It's simple, flexible, and only requires a basic understanding
of Python to customize.
